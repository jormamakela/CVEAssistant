# CVEAssistant
Generalized assistant for CVE workflows.

# Why?
Becausse having a generalized tool to help people managing and reading Debian or other security vulns and mapping them nicely against CVE information from NVD or other sources is annoying to find. During my work at Cisco Systems, I'd loved to have such a tool available to keep better track of what was going on in the field. Hence, this tool.

And to help some friends out there to have relatively "standard" output to put into bug reports etc to fully understand scope of work associated is important.

# This is awful
Why, yes it will be. Don't worry. It really is a hacky way of doing things. It's dirty awful code. But hopefully it'll get things still done.

# Why don't you use tool XYZ already out there?
Is it free? It is pretty? Did it force me to write something from scratch again after many years to keep my skillset up? Did it solve my problem that I was having? None knows. If there is another set of tools out there with exact same tooling etc, great. This repo and tool is intended as a way for reinforce language learning for me as it is to be useful. The more tools, the merrier. Really. This is not intended to replace or solve issues that other tools may provide. Instead it is more for myself, and should anyone else benefit from using it.

# Licenses
Two portion license, separate for normal end user and commercial. 

# License - Commercial use
Reach out. I rather know how my tool is used, where it's used, and how we (people concerned with getting security and vulnerability information easily accessible and in usable format) can work together to make it better. Would love to be recognized if tool is used in field. If code is intended to be shipped with product, please reach out to discuss options. If code is used as part of everyday business operations, please reach out. Licensing model of per user is negotiable, as this may generates strain on amount of code churn required to keep this stable and/or new features implemented. Beyond that, code is made available as is. Any code present will retain copyright to whomever submits the said code, and in cases where it is ambiquous, rights are retained by me. Typical no guarantees that this will end up doing something to your systems, so run it with your own risk, and as such, it is recommended to check code before executing it.

# License - Normal End User
What are you doing in this repo? Who are you and how did you find your way here? For end users that are not tied to executing this as part of business use licensing should not be bothered by the financial aspects. Instead. 1) My repo, my copyright. 2) Code is available as is. No warranty or safe operation assumed. Executor carries all risk of running or compiling the associated code. The code is public and freely distributable for non-business use.
