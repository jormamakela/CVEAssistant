        <h1>CVE Assistant</h1>
        
    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    
        <p>
            CVE Assistant is a generalize assistant for CVE workflows. Having a generalized tool to help managing and reading Debian or other security vulnerabilities
            and mapping them against CVE information from NVD or other sources is difficult to find. During my work at Cisco Systems, I would've love to have such a 
            tool available to keep better track of what was going on in the field. Hence, this tool.
        </p>
        <p>
            This tool is also important to help people out there to have a relatively standard output to assist with bug reports and to fully understand the scope of work.
        </p>

    <h2>Why use this tool?</h2>
        
        <p>
            Is it free? Did it force me to write something from scratch again after many years to keep my skillset up? Did it solve my problem I was having? No one knows.
            If there is another set of tools out there with the exact same purpose, then great. This assistant is intended as a way to reinforce language learning for me,
            even as it's meant to be useful. The more tools the merrier. Really. This isn't intended to replace or solve issues that other tools may provide. Instead, it
            is more for myself and anyone else who might benefit from using it.
        </p> 
    
    <h2>Licenses</h2>

        <p>
            There are two separate licenses: Commercial use and Noncommercial use.
        </p>

            <h3>Commercial use</h3>

                <p>Reach out to me. I'd rather know how my tool is being used, where it's used, and how we can work together to make it better. I would love to be
                   recognized if the tool is being used in the field. 
                </p>   

                   <ol>
                       <li>If the code is intended to be shipped with a product, please reach out to discuss options.</li>
                       <li>If the code is used as part of everyday business operations, please reach out.</li>
                   </ol> 
                
                <p>
                    A licensing model on a per user basis is negotiable as this may generate strain on the amount of code churn is required to keep this tool stable
                    and/or for new features to be implemented. Beyond that, updates will be available when possible. Any code present will retain copyright to whomever
                    submits the said code, and in cases where it is ambiguous, rights are retained by me. There are no guarantees this tool will perform well on your
                    systems, so run it at your own risk. It is recommended to check the code before executing it.
                </p>
            
            <h3>Noncommercial use</h3>

                <p>
                    What are you doing on this web page? For end users who are not tied to executing this as part of commercial use licensing, you shouldn't be bothered 
                    by any financial aspects. The code is public and freely distributable for non-business use. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    However:

                        <li>My repo is my copyright.</li>

                        <li>No warranty or safe operations are assumed.</li> 
                        <li>Executor carries all risk of running or compiling the associated code.</li>
                    </ol>
